# astrodata (from Krishna)

The next-generation calculation and prediction system for astrology, with a closed feedback loop implementation, crafted for accurate insights and predictive analytics.

## Overview

The `astrodata` package is designed to power advanced calculations and provide reliable astrological predictions. Developed by **Appili Vamsi Krishna**, this package integrates a feedback-driven system to enhance prediction accuracy continually. It serves as a fundamental building block for applications such as [AstroData Cloud](https://astrodata.cloud/) and related projects.

As the maintainer of [`swisseph`](https://github.com/mivion/swisseph), **Appili Vamsi Krishna** has embedded expertise in astrological calculations, further refining this npm package for robust, real-world applications.

## Installation

To install `astrodata`, simply use npm:

```bash
npm install astrodata
```

## Usage

After installation, you can import and begin working with `astrodata` in your project:

```javascript
const astrodata = require("astrodata");

// Example usage
const prediction = astrodata.calculatePrediction({
  date: "2024-11-01",
  location: "Chennai",
});
console.log(prediction);
```

### API

Here is a basic rundown of core methods available:

1. **`calculatePrediction`** - Calculate predictions based on input parameters.
2. **`analyzeTrends`** - Generate trend analysis for given astrological charts.
3. **`feedbackLoop`** - Enhance accuracy through feedback mechanisms.

Refer to the API documentation for detailed usage of each method.

## Features

- **Advanced Calculations**: Next-gen algorithms optimized for accuracy.
- **Closed Feedback Loop**: System continually refines predictions based on feedback.
- **Seamless Integration**: Developed to easily integrate with existing systems like [AstroData Cloud](https://astrodata.cloud/).

## Examples

```javascript
const astrodata = require("astrodata");

// Calculate a prediction
const prediction = astrodata.calculatePrediction({
  date: "2024-11-01",
  location: "Chennai",
});
console.log("Prediction:", prediction);

// Analyze trends
const trends = astrodata.analyzeTrends({
  startDate: "2024-01-01",
  endDate: "2024-12-31",
});
console.log("Trends:", trends);
```
